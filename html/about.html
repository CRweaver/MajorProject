               <h2>MY STORY</h2>
                <div class="read-more"><a href="#">+</a> 2004-09
                    <p>I studied psychology and at Simon Fraser University and completed my BA in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
                    <p>I started to have severe anxiety attacks and wound up in counselling several times.</p>
                    <p>I became a yoga teacher &amp; taught thousands of people how to create physical health. I still didn’t fit in. I wasn’t skinny or good at showy asana (postures).</p>
                    <p>I was cynical about the yoga world and lacked faith in the physical exercise we promoted as yoga.</p>
                    <p>I found my own way to manage my stress and anxiety through yoga &amp; meditation</p>
                </div>
                <div class="read-more"><a href="#">+</a> 2011
                    <p>I fell in love with an amazing man, and moved to Sydney, Australia </p>
                    <p>I attended my first 10-day vispassana meditation retreat. Mind officially blown.</p>
                    <p>I stopped teaching yoga.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="read-more"><a href="#">+</a> 2012-14
                    <p>I got a full time job at a pub serving cheap steaks.</p>
                    <p>I committed to my meditation practice daily.</p>
                    <p>I met some amazing people that urged me back into teaching yoga. This time, I decided to take a risk and teach from my heart.
                        <br/> + Even if no one came to my classes. I was terrified and excited. </p>
                    <p>I went back to vispassana in the Blue Mountains.</p>
                    <p>I made a promise to myself to trust my own inner wisdom above all else.</p>
                    <p>Yoga jobs started streaming in. I now had a platform to share my truth.</p>
                    <p>I became a published writer for the first time. Thanks Elephant Journal.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="read-more"><a href="#">+</a> 2015
                    <p> I created this website in the hopes of inspiring women all over the world to embrace who they really are. </p>
                    <p> I enrolled in the Beautiful You Coaching Academy to deepen my understanding of how to work one-on-one with women who want to fall in love with their natural body, define health and wellness on their own terms and lead a kick as authentic life. </p>
